                <p className='text-xl md:mt-16 mt-12'>Rather than relying on revenue derived from aggressive token emissions to provide investors with yield like many unsuccessful DeFi projects of 2021, Gold Retriever aims to provide investors with volume-based yield in the form of a sustainable stablecoin. The success of Gold Retriever depends on its ability to accrue new users and increase transaction volume over time to reward token holders.</p>

                <p className='text-xl mt-8'>Holders of $GLDN will be a part of a much larger ecosystem where investors are rewarded with the hottest commodities, including precious metals, energy, grains, and more. $GLDN holders will get first access to future assets in Gold Retrieverâ€™s ever-growing ecosystem.<br/><br/>As a nod to our namesake, we have allocated a portion of $GLDN tokens and transaction fees to donate to Golden Retriever and other dog rescues/non-profit charities</p>
